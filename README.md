# iot_servo_blynk
IoT Servo Control with Blynk is a project that allows you to control servo motors remotely using the Blynk app on a mobile phone. Servo motors are commonly used in robotics and automation projects to precisely control angular positions. With this project, you can use the Blynk app to control the angle of a servo motor from anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection.

# Key Features:
1. Remote Servo Motor Control: Control the angle of the servo motor wirelessly through the Blynk app on your smartphone.
Customizable Interface: Create a user-friendly interface in the Blynk app for controlling servo motors. You can design buttons, sliders, or other widgets to manipulate the servo position.
2. Real-Time Feedback: Get real-time feedback on the angle of the servo motor, allowing you to make precise adjustments.
3. Authentication and Security: Connect your hardware to the Blynk app securely by using authentication tokens for added security.
4. Internet of Things (IoT): Explore IoT capabilities by remotely controlling physical devices over the internet.

# Hardware Requirements:
1. Arduino or compatible microcontroller with Wi-Fi capabilities (e.g., ESP8266, ESP32)
2. Servo motor
3. Blynk app installed on your smartphone
4. Stable internet connection

# Software and Libraries:
1. Arduino IDE
2. Blynk IoT platform (Blynk App and Blynk Cloud)
3. Appropriate board support for your microcontroller (for example, ESP8266 or ESP32)
4. Servo library for Arduino

# How to Set Up:
1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the provided sketch for your microcontroller (for example, ESP8266 or ESP32).
3. Set up the required libraries in your Arduino IDE (Blynk and servo libraries).
4. Configure the sketch with your Wi-Fi credentials and Blynk authentication token.
5. Upload the sketch to your microcontroller.
6. Create a new project within the Blynk app and design an interface to control the servo motor.
7. Connect your hardware to your Wi-Fi network.
8. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to monitor the connection status of the device.
9. Run the Blynk app on your smartphone and control the servo motor remotely.
